/* Q7. You are building a weather application. Write a JavaScript program that takes the current temperature
 as input and uses the conditional (ternary) operator to determine and print the weather condition. If the
temperature is above 30Â°C, the condition is "Hot"; otherwise, it is "Moderate".     */
